**Title of Research Study:** Cognitive processes in statistical learning

**Principal Investigator:**	Matthew Crump, Ph.D. â€“ Professor

-----

You are being asked to participate in this research study because you are over 18 years of age. The purpose of this research study is to gain more knowledge about the cognitive processes involved in learning about statistical relationships.

- If you agree to participate, we will ask you to complete a computerized task involving the following: While seated at a computer hear a series of sounds, such as musical notes, short natural sounds, or abstract sound textures and be asked to make judgments about the items or relationships between the items.

- There are no risks for participating in this study beyond those associated with normal computer use. 

- Although it will not directly benefit you, this study will advance basic science on the cognitive processes involved in statistical learning, which could eventually help develop better curriculum for making skill-learning more efficient. This study does not involve any medical treatment

- Data records of your performance in the task will be stored indefinitely, and may be shared publicly via online repositories. This study does not collect identifying information, and all data collected will remain anonymous. 


Your participation in this research is voluntary. If you have any questions, you can contact Dr. Matthew Crump by email at  <mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu>. If you have any questions about your rights as a research participant or if you would like to talk to someone other than the researchers, you can contact CUNY Research Compliance Administrator at 646-664-8918 or <HRPP@cuny.edu>.
