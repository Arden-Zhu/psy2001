    "text": "The Interactive Stroop Test is my first try in JsPsych. The Stroop Test\nIn the Stroop test, a colored text is shown on the center of the screen, and participants are instructed to press a specific key according to the color of the text as soon as possible. They should ignore the text. Before the participants engage in the test, they read an instruction that designates individual keys to four colors. Then, they do some practice to remember the key mapping. Now, the trial starts. Ten randomly picked congruent stimuli mixed with ten incongruent ones are presented one by one. The participants press a key for each stimulus, and the pressed key and the response time are recorded. After a total of 20 stimuli get a response, the accuracy and average response time are calculated and shown to the participants.\nThere are some questions left:\n\nIt is not a very simple task to remember four color-to-key mappings. The memory loading may be a confound. The practice before the test is an imperfect method to reduce the confound. How can we eliminate the confound?\nHow to enlarge or reduce the Stroop effect? For example, making the text upside down should hurt the effect. How about making the font size larger or smaller?\n\nTodo:\n\nSave trail results on a server. Done\n\nGo to the Stroop Test. It is a single html file, and you can review the code by clicking “view page source” in the browser’s popup menu.\n\n9/20/2023\nIt is useful to add a survey at the beginning of the experiment to collect geographic and interesting background information, to screen the participants, and to get consent. It may also helpful to ask participants to write some feedback at the end of the experiement.\nAdding a survey is rather straightfoward by using a JsPsych plugin Survey. I added a survey in which I asked two questions.\n\n\n9/24/2023\n\nadd a fixation of 500ms and a blank after fixation of 500ms\nadd a feedback after each trial which shows whether the input is correct or wrong"

While our analysis suggests that lower pay doesn’t necessarily affect the quality of the data, we have found that we can recruit participant faster and have fewer dropouts by making the study financially appealing.\nexperiments that are at least somewhat fun and engaging are likely to be better received\nAs with all empirical studies, restrictions should be decided before data collection and clearly reported in papers to avoid excess experimenter degrees of freedom. Additionally, reporting the time of day and date of data collection may be important as the AMT population may evolve over time.\nMost importantly, we found that testing participants’ comprehension of the instructions was critical.\nFinally, it is important to monitor and record the rate at which people begin an experiment but do not finish. We recommend that, perhaps unlike a typical laboratory study, all Internet experiments report dropout rates as a function of condition"
