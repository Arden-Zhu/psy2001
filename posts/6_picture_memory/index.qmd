-   Copied all experiment related files to [/experiments/picture_memory](../../experiments/picture_memory/picture.html)

-   Read the paper [Recognition memory for a rapid sequence of pictures](Recognition memory for a rapid sequence of pictures.pdf)

-   Adjusted the original code

    -   Changed 50 to two const images_per_condition and durations that makes the code easier for extending
    -   Added is_correct to the data

-   Added a new variable blurring/no-blurring. Images in the blurring condition were blurred only in the encoding phrase but no in the recognition phrase. The hypothesis was that blurred images are most difficult to be remembered.

    -   After the first trial, I felt that blurred images needed a longer time to decode. Sometimes, the duration was too short for me to decode and remember the image shown during the interval.

-   Saved data to OSF
