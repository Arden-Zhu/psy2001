Add a variation of stimulus duration into the tradictional Stroop. [The Stroop Test with stimuls duration](../../experiments/Stroop/stroop-duration.html)

1.  Small changes

-   Change Brown to Yellow;
-   change keys to the first letter of the color;
-   update the instruction, specifically, conduct how to place four figures on each keys

2.  Add a new variable of stimulus duration \[25, 100, 250, infinite\]. As the result, congruent stimulus with each stimulus duration has 5 trials; incongruent stimulus with each stimulus duration has 5 trials, too. 5 is defined as a code variable

3.  Some code refactors.
