This is a note written while reading *What makes an image memorable?* written by Phillip Isola and others

# Notes

-   focus on the problem of predicting how memorable an image will be
-   show that memorability is a stable property of an image that is shared across different viewers
-   analyze image features and labels that contribute to making an image memorable,
-   we train a predictor based on global image descriptors.
-   The use of "vigilance task'
-   Semantics boosted performance

# My thoughts

-   It is the most interesting and complex paper I have read this semester because of the methods it used. It created a real memory game for MTurk workers, did a consistency analysis, trained predictor to evaluate memorability on image labels or global image features.
-   Many contents in the paper I could not understand, for example, Support Vector Regression. How can I study the statistical tools required for fully digesting the paper?
-   What are global image descriptors like GIST, SIFT?

# An experimental proposal

-   This is only an imagination. I guess that there are a vector of factors for an image which represents an internal memory model. Two images are distinguishable in long-term memory when the distance of the two vectors are large enough. Thus, the outliners inside a set of images are easier to be remembered and figured out. Generally, an image is memorable because some factors are outstanding above a baseline. The first difficulty of this theory is to find out potential factors, that is out of my capability. :-)
-   The homework requires a practical experiment. Here it is. The study of the paper trained a set of predictors. The new study aims to examine how good these predictors can be generalized. It will get a new image set, evaluate memorability of each images by using the predictors, conduct a similar memory game on the new images, and compare the result with the prediction.
