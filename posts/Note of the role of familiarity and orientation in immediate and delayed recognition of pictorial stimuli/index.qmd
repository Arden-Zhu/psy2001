This is a note written while reading *the role of familiarity and orientation in immediate and delayed recognition of pictorial stimuli*.

-   The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of familiarity and changes in stimulus orientation on immediate and delayed recognition of human faces, canine faces, and buildings.

-   How many degree is the rotation?

-   The results indicate that different degrees of familiarity faiJed to change the unique effect that rotation has on recognition of human faces.

-   The significant decline in recognition performance for familiar stimuli after a 20-min delay contradicts much of the previous research.
