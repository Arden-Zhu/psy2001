This is a note written while reading *Note of How Low Can You Go? Detecting Style in Extremely Low Resolution Images* written by Rachel A. Searston and others

-   the stylistic information retained at extremely low image resolutions is sufficient for visual recognition of images, and visual discrimination of categories
-   In scene recognition terms, Torralba (2009) describes “gist” as a summary of the semantic content of the scene
-   We use visual style here to describe the residual redundant information distributed within and across extremely low resolution image sets.

# Experiment 1: Recognizing Natural Images at Extremely Low Resolutions 

-   we test whether people can recognize natural images based on their most redundant visual features, by gradually reducing their resolution down to one pixel.
-   reducing the resolution of images appears to limit people’s capacity to rely on conceptual understanding to aid image recognition
-   all of the images were first downsampled to eight different resolutions (128×128, 64×64, 32×32, 16×16, 8×8, 4×4, 2×2, and 1×1) and then upsampled to 256×256.

## Image Resolution

-   We generated eight different versions of every image in our three sets, at 1 pixel, 2×2, 4×4, 8×8, 16×16, 32×32, 64×64, and 128×128 pixels, using a nearest neighbor resampling procedure in Matlab (see Figures 2 and 3, for an example image from each domain at each of the eight image resolutions). All images were then upsampled to 256×256 pixels.4

## Participants

## Procedure

-   In each learning phase, participants viewed 12 images appearing on screen for 4 seconds at a time, separated by a 500 millisecond interval. In each test phase, participants also viewed 12 images with an old/new response scale appearing on screen.

## Results

## Discriminability

-   This analysis revealed that participants performed significantly greater than chance for all image resolution conditions, including the one pixel images, t(49) = 9.36, p < .001, d = 1.32

## Response Bias

-   Participants in our experiment tended to say, “old” more than “new” (b = 1.15; SD = .37).

## Rate Correct

-   RCS is also easy to interpret, and can be described here as the number of correct responses per second.

## Discussion

# Experiment 2: Discriminating Natural Images at Extremely Low Resolutions 

-   we show people two images on screen, side-by-side. Their task is to decide whether these two images are from the same category or two different categories.
